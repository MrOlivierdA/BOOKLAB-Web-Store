## Learning objectives

- MySQL
- Laravel
- React improvements
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Follow your choosen design strictly
- Deliver within the dead-line
- Create a deep understanding how Front-end and Back-end are connected.

## Introduction

Some of us use it daily, The internet is full of it, yes - I am talking about an online webshop. But instead of using one, you will be creating one!

## The UX

There will be two interfaces:

- The client interface (the website).
- The admin dashboard.

#### The Client will be able to do the following things:

- Login/Register in order to be able to buy items.
- Browse through different products/categories.
- Use a searchbar to look for a specific shopping item.
- Filter products based on the category, price, etc...
- Like/review product.
- Add products to the cart/wishlist.
- The user can add more then one piece of each product.
- Place the order (skip the payment process - for the ones that want, set up a fake payment process.)
- Edit/Delete the account

#### The admin will be able to do the following things:

- Add/list products
- Update product details, quantity.
- See all running orders.
- View a list of all users in the system.
- Ban/unban a single user.

## Before coding...

This project quite some "pages", it's up to you to figure out which pages you need to realise this project.

> ‚òùÔ∏è Dream big but start small - Prioritize at the beginning the things you think are most critical. This way you will always have something beautiful to show.

## Implementation

Besides a few constrains listed below, you're free to use anything you want for this project.

### Mockup & Design

We didn't make any mockup nor design for this project, this will be the first task for your group. Create or find a suitable design. You can remake existing webshops.

### Technical Stack

You will have a technical stack to follow.

#### Back-end

A `Rest-like API` using:

- Laravel
- MySQL

#### Front-end

A `Single Page App` using:

- React
- TypeScript
